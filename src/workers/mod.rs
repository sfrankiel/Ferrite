//! Generic worker infrastructure for background async operations.
//!
//! This module provides a pattern for running async (tokio) operations in background threads
//! without blocking the main UI thread (egui is single-threaded and must never block).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - Main thread (egui): Sends commands via mpsc, polls for responses
//! - Worker thread: Runs tokio runtime, processes commands, sends responses
//! - Communication: std::sync::mpsc channels (cross thread-boundary safe)
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use crate::workers::{WorkerHandle, WorkerCommand, WorkerResponse, echo_worker};
//!
//! // Spawn worker in background thread
//! let handle = WorkerHandle::spawn(echo_worker);
//!
//! // Send command from UI thread
//! handle.command_tx.send(WorkerCommand::Echo("Hello".to_string())).unwrap();
//!
//! // Poll for responses (non-blocking)
//! if let Ok(response) = handle.response_rx.try_recv() {
//!     match response {
//!         WorkerResponse::Echo(msg) => println!("{}", msg),
//!         _ => {}
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
