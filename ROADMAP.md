# Ferrite Roadmap

## Known Issues 🐛

### Blocked by egui TextEdit
These issues cannot be fixed without replacing egui's built-in text editor:
- [ ] **Multi-cursor incomplete** - Basic cursor rendering works, but text operations not implemented
- [ ] **Code folding incomplete** - Detection works, but text hiding not possible
- [ ] **Scroll sync imperfect** - Limited access to egui's internal scroll state

---

## Planned Features 🚀

### v0.2.2 (Planned) - Performance & Stability

> **Status:** In Progress

A focused release addressing performance issues with large files and fixing stability bugs.

#### Bug Fixes
- [ ] **UTF-8 crash in tree viewer** - Fix string slicing panic when displaying JSON/YAML strings containing multi-byte characters (Norwegian øæå, Chinese, emoji, etc.)

#### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Large file performance** - Reduce lag when editing 5000+ line files with syntax highlighting enabled
- [ ] **Syntax highlighting optimization** - Incremental re-highlighting, viewport-only rendering, or caching strategies
- [ ] **Scroll performance** - Smoother scrolling in large documents

#### Mermaid Improvements
- [ ] **Rendering performance** - Optimize mermaid.rs for complex diagrams
- [ ] **Code cleanup** - Address unused code warnings, improve modularity

---

### v0.3.0 (Planned) - Mermaid Crate + Editor Improvements

> **Status:** Planning  
> **Docs:** [Mermaid Crate Plan](docs/mermaid-crate-plan.md) | [Custom Editor Plan](docs/technical/custom-editor-widget-plan.md) | [Modular Refactor Plan](docs/refactor.md)

v0.3.0 focuses on extracting the Mermaid renderer as a standalone crate and continuing diagram improvements.

#### 1. Mermaid Crate Extraction
Extract Ferrite's native Mermaid renderer (~6000 lines) into a standalone pure-Rust crate.

- [ ] **Standalone crate** - Backend-agnostic architecture with SVG, PNG, and egui outputs
- [ ] **Public API** - `parse()`, `layout()`, `render()` pipeline
- [ ] **SVG export** - Generate valid SVG files from diagrams
- [ ] **PNG export** - Rasterize via resvg
- [ ] **WASM compatible** - SVG backend works in browsers

#### 2. Mermaid Diagram Improvements
Continue improving diagram rendering quality:

##### Git Graph (Major Rewrite)
- [ ] **Horizontal timeline layout** - Left-to-right commit flow like Mermaid
- [ ] **Branch lanes** - Distinct horizontal lanes per branch with colored labels
- [ ] **Merge visualization** - Curved paths connecting branches
- [ ] **Tags and highlights** - Visual markers on commits

##### Flowchart
- [ ] **More node shapes** - Parallelogram, trapezoid, double-circle, etc.
- [ ] **Styling syntax** - `style` and `classDef` directives

##### State Diagram
- [ ] **Fork/join pseudostates** - Parallel regions
- [ ] **History states** - Shallow (H) and deep (H*) history

#### 3. Custom Editor Widget (Stretch Goal)
Replace egui's `TextEdit` with a custom `FerriteEditor` widget to unblock advanced editing features.

- [ ] **FerriteEditor widget** - Custom text editor using egui drawing primitives
- [ ] **Rope-based buffer** - Efficient text storage via `ropey` crate
- [ ] **Full multi-cursor editing** - Text operations at all cursor positions
- [ ] **Code folding with text hiding** - Actually collapse regions visually

#### Platform & Distribution
- [ ] **macOS app signing & notarization** - Create proper `.app` bundle, sign with Developer ID, notarize with Apple

### Future (v0.4.0+)
- [ ] Spell checking
- [ ] Custom themes (import/export)
- [ ] Virtual/ghost text (AI completions, etc.)
- [ ] Column/box selection

### Long-Term Vision

#### Headless Editor Library
Extract `FerriteEditor` as a standalone, framework-agnostic text editing library for the Rust ecosystem.

> **Context:** There's currently no general-purpose "headless" code editor library in Rust. Existing implementations (egui's TextEdit, Lapce/Floem, Zed/gpui) are tightly coupled to their UI frameworks. The v0.3.0 custom editor and modular architecture lay the groundwork for potential extraction.

**Prerequisites (from v0.3.0):**
- Custom `FerriteEditor` widget with rope-based buffer
- Modular architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Framework-agnostic core logic

**Extraction would involve:**
- [ ] Abstract rendering backend (trait-based: egui, wgpu, vello, SVG, etc.)
- [ ] Framework-agnostic input handling
- [ ] Standalone crate with minimal dependencies
- [ ] Integration with [Parley](https://github.com/linebender/parley) for advanced text layout/shaping (optional)
