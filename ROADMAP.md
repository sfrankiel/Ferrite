# Ferrite Roadmap

## Known Issues 🐛

### Blocked by egui TextEdit
These issues cannot be fixed without replacing egui's built-in text editor:
- [ ] **Multi-cursor incomplete** - Basic cursor rendering works, but text operations not implemented
- [ ] **Code folding incomplete** - Detection works, but text hiding not possible
- [ ] **Scroll sync imperfect** - Limited access to egui's internal scroll state
- [ ] **IME candidate box positioning** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Chinese/Japanese IME candidate window appears offset from cursor position; egui's IME support is limited
- [ ] **IME undo behavior** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Undoing during IME composition may delete an extra character; related to egui's text input handling

- [ ] **Syntax hints in Help** ([#4](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/4)) - Documentation of supported diagram types and syntax examples

#### CSV Support ([#19](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/19))
Native CSV file support with specialized viewing and editing capabilities.

- [ ] **CSV Tree Viewer** - Table view with fixed-width column alignment (like EmEditor)
- [ ] **Rainbow column coloring** - Alternating column colors for readability (like RainbowCSV)
- [ ] **Delimiter detection** - Auto-detect comma, tab, semicolon, pipe separators
- [ ] **Header row detection** - Highlight first row as column headers
- [ ] **Large file performance** - Virtual scrolling for CSVs with thousands of rows

#### Internationalization ([#18](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/18))
Multi-language UI support with community-driven translations.

- [ ] **i18n infrastructure** - Add `rust-i18n` crate with YAML translation files
- [ ] **String extraction** - Move all UI strings (~300-400) to translation keys
- [ ] **Language selector** - Settings option to choose UI language
- [ ] **Locale detection** - Auto-detect system language on first launch
- [ ] **Weblate integration** - Set up hosted.weblate.org for community translations
- [ ] **Simplified Chinese** - First community translation (thanks @sr79368142!)

#### CJK Writing Conventions ([#20](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/20))
First-line paragraph indentation for Chinese, Japanese, and other languages with similar conventions.

- [ ] **Paragraph indentation setting** - New option in Settings: Off / Chinese (2 chars) / Japanese (1 char) / Custom
- [ ] **Rendered view support** - Apply `text-indent` styling to paragraphs in preview mode
- [ ] **HTML export support** - Include indentation in exported HTML documents
- [ ] **Per-document override** - Optional YAML frontmatter key to override global setting

#### Bug Fixes & Polish
- [ ] **Session restore reliability** - Investigate workspace folder not being remembered on restart; audit all persistence logic to prevent unnecessary "recover work" dialogs
- [ ] **Recent files persistence** - Audit when/how recent files list is saved and loaded; ensure it survives build-to-build testing
- [ ] **Config.json persistence** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Settings reset on restart: recent files count reverts to 10, maximize state not restored, window size reverts after drag-to-open workflow
- [ ] **Zen mode rendered centering** - Center content in rendered/split view when Zen mode (F11) is active (currently only centers raw text)
- [ ] **Git status auto-refresh** - Refresh git indicators on file save and periodically (every ~10 seconds) instead of only on folder open
- [ ] **Quick switcher mouse support** - Fix mouse hover/click not working (item flickers but doesn't select); arrow keys + Enter work fine
- [ ] **Table editing cursor loss** - Fix cursor losing focus after each keystroke when editing tables in rendered mode (related to previous cursor issues)
- [ ] **Line width in rendered/split view** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Fix line width setting not respecting pane boundaries in rendered view; text should wrap at pane edge when line width exceeds available space

#### macOS Intel Issues ([#24](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/24))
Issues reported on Intel Macs (x86_64).

- [ ] **High CPU usage** - Constant elevated CPU usage when app is open (likely egui repaint loop not properly idling)
- [ ] **Sync scrolling broken** - Bidirectional scroll sync between Raw/Rendered views not working on Intel Macs
- [ ] **Window controls style** - Shows Windows-style Close/Minimize/Maximize icons instead of native macOS traffic lights

#### Windows Borderless Window Issues ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15))
Issues related to the custom borderless window on Windows.

- [ ] **Window resize from top edge** - Currently can only resize window height by dragging the bottom edge; top edge doesn't respond to resize drag
- [ ] **Fullscreen toggle** - No dedicated fullscreen button in UI; F11 triggers Zen mode (distraction-free writing) not OS-level fullscreen

> **Note:** Previous reports of click offset and black bars on Windows 10 22H2 were resolved by switching GPU settings from "auto-select" to "discrete GPU" in Windows Graphics Settings. This is a system configuration issue, not a Ferrite bug.

#### New Features
- [ ] **Recent folders** - Extend the recent files menu (bottom-left status bar) into a split view with two columns: recent files and recent workspace folders for quick project switching
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcut customization** - Let users rebind shortcuts via settings panel; store in config.json
- [ ] **Drag & drop images** - Drop images into editor → auto-save to `./assets/` folder → insert markdown image link
- [ ] **Table of Contents generation** - Insert/update `<!-- TOC -->` block with auto-generated heading links; keep in sync on save
- [ ] **Document statistics panel** - Tabbed info panel for .md files: Outline tab + Statistics tab (heading count, link count, code block count, image count, word count, reading time, average sentence length)
- [ ] **Snippets/abbreviations** - User-defined text expansions (`;date` → current date, `;sig` → signature block); JSON config in `~/.config/ferrite/snippets.json`
- [ ] **Custom font selection** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Allow users to select their preferred font for editor and UI; important for CJK users who have regional glyph preferences (SC vs TC vs JP vs KR variants)

#### Executable Code Blocks
Run code snippets directly in the rendered preview — inspired by Jupyter notebooks and Marco.

- [ ] **Run button on code blocks** - Add "▶ Run" button to fenced code blocks in rendered/split view
- [ ] **Shell/Bash execution** - Execute shell scripts via `std::process::Command`; display stdout/stderr below block
- [ ] **Python support** - Detect `python` or `python3` and run with system interpreter
- [ ] **Output persistence** - Option to keep output visible or clear on re-run
- [ ] **Timeout handling** - Kill long-running scripts after configurable timeout (default 30s)
- [ ] **Security warning** - First-run dialog warning about code execution risks; require opt-in in settings

> **Security Note:** Code execution is inherently risky. This feature will be opt-in and disabled by default. Users must explicitly enable it in settings.

#### Content Blocks (Callouts/Admonitions)
Styled callout blocks for notes, warnings, tips — common in technical documentation (Obsidian, Notion, GitHub).

- [ ] **GitHub-style syntax** - Support `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`
- [ ] **Custom titles** - Support `> [!NOTE] Custom Title` syntax
- [ ] **Styled rendering** - Color-coded blocks with icons (ℹ️ 💡 ⚠️ 🔴 ❗) in rendered view
- [ ] **Collapsible variant** - `> [!NOTE]- Collapsed by default` syntax for expandable sections
- [ ] **Nesting support** - Allow content blocks inside other blocks and lists

#### Semantic Minimap
Enhanced minimap designed specifically for Markdown documents - show structure, not just pixels.

- [ ] **Header labels** - Display actual H1/H2/H3 text in minimap instead of unreadable scaled pixels
- [ ] **Content type indicators** - Visual markers for code blocks (```), mermaid diagrams, tables, images, blockquotes
- [ ] **Density visualization** - Show text density as subtle horizontal bars between headers
- [ ] **Sleek design** - Minimal, elegant styling that complements the editor aesthetic
- [ ] **Mode toggle** - Settings option to choose "Visual" (current pixel-based) or "Semantic" (new structured) mode

#### Branding
New Ferrite logo and icon set.

- [x] **New logo design** - Ferrite crystal icon (orange geometric crystal shape)
- [x] **Windows icon** - Multi-size `.ico` file (16, 32, 48, 256px) embedded in executable
- [x] **macOS iconset** - `.iconset` folder for CI-generated `.icns`
- [x] **Linux icons** - PNG icons for `.deb` package (16-512px)
- [x] **Window icon** - Embedded 256px icon replaces default eframe "E" logo
- [x] **Icon generation script** - `assets/icons/generate_all_icons.py` for regenerating all sizes

### v0.3.0 (Planned) - Mermaid Crate + Editor Improvements

> **Status:** Planning  
> **Docs:** [Mermaid Crate Plan](docs/mermaid-crate-plan.md) | [Custom Editor Plan](docs/technical/custom-editor-widget-plan.md) | [Modular Refactor Plan](docs/refactor.md)

v0.3.0 focuses on extracting the Mermaid renderer as a standalone crate and continuing diagram improvements.

#### 1. Mermaid Crate Extraction
Extract Ferrite's native Mermaid renderer (~6000 lines) into a standalone pure-Rust crate.

- [ ] **Standalone crate** - Backend-agnostic architecture with SVG, PNG, and egui outputs
- [ ] **Public API** - `parse()`, `layout()`, `render()` pipeline
- [ ] **SVG export** - Generate valid SVG files from diagrams
- [ ] **PNG export** - Rasterize via resvg
- [ ] **WASM compatible** - SVG backend works in browsers

#### 2. Mermaid Diagram Improvements
Continue improving diagram rendering quality:

##### Git Graph (Major Rewrite)
- [ ] **Horizontal timeline layout** - Left-to-right commit flow like Mermaid
- [ ] **Branch lanes** - Distinct horizontal lanes per branch with colored labels
- [ ] **Merge visualization** - Curved paths connecting branches
- [ ] **Tags and highlights** - Visual markers on commits

##### Flowchart
- [ ] **More node shapes** - Parallelogram, trapezoid, double-circle, etc.
- [ ] **Styling syntax** - `style` and `classDef` directives

##### State Diagram
- [ ] **Fork/join pseudostates** - Parallel regions
- [ ] **History states** - Shallow (H) and deep (H*) history

##### Manual Layout Support
Enable manual node positioning while maintaining mermaid.js compatibility — a key differentiator for mermaid-rs.

- [ ] **Comment-based position hints** - Parse `%% @pos <node_id> <x> <y>` directives (ignored by mermaid.js, respected by Ferrite)
- [ ] **Layout mode toggle** - Support `%% @ferrite-layout: manual` to enable manual positioning
- [ ] **Drag-to-reposition** - Drag nodes in rendered view → auto-update source with position comments
- [ ] **Export options** - "Export clean" strips layout hints for sharing pure Mermaid syntax
- [ ] **Fallback behavior** - Diagrams without position hints use auto-layout (Sugiyama, etc.)

> **Why this matters:** Mermaid is declarative — layout is computed, not specified. This prevents "visual thinking" workflows where users want to arrange diagrams as thought tools. By using `%%` comments (which mermaid.js ignores), we add manual positioning without breaking compatibility. Diagrams remain valid Mermaid syntax and render everywhere — just with different layouts.

#### 3. Custom Editor Widget (Stretch Goal)
Replace egui's `TextEdit` with a custom `FerriteEditor` widget to unblock advanced editing features.

- [ ] **FerriteEditor widget** - Custom text editor using egui drawing primitives
- [ ] **Rope-based buffer** - Efficient text storage via `ropey` crate
- [ ] **Full multi-cursor editing** - Text operations at all cursor positions
- [ ] **Code folding with text hiding** - Actually collapse regions visually

#### 4. Markdown Enhancements
- [ ] **Wikilinks support** ([#1](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/1)) - `[[wikilinks]]` syntax with auto-completion
- [ ] **Backlinks panel** ([#1](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/1)) - Show documents linking to current file

#### 5. Platform & Distribution
Improve installation experience across all platforms.

##### Windows Installer
- [ ] **Inno Setup installer** - Professional `.exe` installer (like the Linux `.deb`)
- [ ] **File associations** - Register as handler for `.md`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml` files
- [ ] **Context menu integration** - "Open with Ferrite" for files and folders (workspace mode)
- [ ] **Add to PATH option** - Run `ferrite` from any terminal
- [ ] **Start Menu & Desktop shortcuts** - Standard Windows integration
- [ ] **Clean uninstaller** - Remove all registry entries on uninstall
- [ ] **CI automation** - Build installer automatically in GitHub Actions release workflow

##### macOS
- [ ] **App signing & notarization** - Create proper `.app` bundle, sign with Developer ID, notarize with Apple

### v0.4.0 (Planned) - TeX Math Support

> **Status:** Planning  
> **Docs:** [Math Support Plan](docs/math-support-plan.md)

Native LaTeX/TeX math rendering - the most requested feature for academic and technical writing. Pure Rust implementation, no JavaScript dependencies.

#### Math Rendering Engine
- [ ] **LaTeX parser** - Parse `$...$` (inline) and `$$...$$` (display) syntax
- [ ] **Layout engine** - TeX-style box model for fractions, subscripts, radicals
- [ ] **Math fonts** - Embedded glyph subset for consistent cross-platform rendering
- [ ] **egui integration** - Render math in preview and split views

#### Supported LaTeX (Target)
- [ ] **Fractions** - `\frac{a}{b}` with proper stacking
- [ ] **Subscripts/superscripts** - `x^2`, `x_i`, `x_i^2`
- [ ] **Greek letters** - `\alpha`, `\beta`, `\pi`, etc.
- [ ] **Operators** - `\sum`, `\int`, `\prod`, `\lim`
- [ ] **Roots** - `\sqrt{x}`, `\sqrt[n]{x}`
- [ ] **Delimiters** - Auto-scaling `\left( \right)`
- [ ] **Matrices** - `\begin{matrix}...\end{matrix}`
- [ ] **Font styles** - `\mathbf`, `\mathit`, `\mathrm`

#### WYSIWYG Features (Requires FerriteEditor from v0.3.0)
- [ ] **Inline math preview** - See rendered math while typing (Typora-style)
- [ ] **Click-to-edit** - Click rendered math to edit source
- [ ] **Symbol palette** - Quick access to common symbols

---

### Future (v0.5.0+)
- [ ] **Memory-mapped file I/O** ([#19](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/19)) - Handle GB-scale CSV/JSON files efficiently without loading into RAM
- [ ] **TODO list editing UX** - Smart cursor behavior in task lists (respect line start position, don't jump past `- [ ]` syntax)
- [ ] Spell checking
- [ ] Custom themes (import/export)
- [ ] Virtual/ghost text (AI completions, etc.)
- [ ] Column/box selection

#### Additional Markup Formats ([#21](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/21))
Support for markup languages beyond Markdown, enabled by the plugin system.

- [ ] **AsciiDoc support** - Parser and renderer for AsciiDoc syntax (requires plugin system or native Rust parser)
- [ ] **Zim-Wiki support** - Parser and renderer for Zim Desktop Wiki syntax
- [ ] **Format auto-detection** - Detect markup format from file extension or content

### Long-Term Vision

#### Plugin System
Extensibility architecture for custom functionality, inspired by Obsidian's plugin ecosystem.

- [ ] **Plugin API design** - Define extension points (commands, views, file handlers)
- [ ] **Scripting support** - Lua, WASM, or Rhai-based plugins
- [ ] **Community plugins** - Distribution and discovery mechanism

#### Headless Editor Library
Extract `FerriteEditor` as a standalone, framework-agnostic text editing library for the Rust ecosystem.

> **Context:** There's currently no general-purpose "headless" code editor library in Rust. Existing implementations (egui's TextEdit, Lapce/Floem, Zed/gpui) are tightly coupled to their UI frameworks. The v0.3.0 custom editor and modular architecture lay the groundwork for potential extraction.

**Prerequisites (from v0.3.0):**
- Custom `FerriteEditor` widget with rope-based buffer
- Modular architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Framework-agnostic core logic

**Extraction would involve:**
- [ ] Abstract rendering backend (trait-based: egui, wgpu, vello, SVG, etc.)
- [ ] Framework-agnostic input handling
- [ ] Standalone crate with minimal dependencies
- [ ] Integration with [Parley](https://github.com/linebender/parley) for advanced text layout/shaping (optional)
