# Ferrite Roadmap

## Known Issues 🐛

### Blocked by egui TextEdit
These issues cannot be fixed without replacing egui's built-in text editor:
- [ ] **Multi-cursor incomplete** - Basic cursor rendering works, but text operations not implemented
- [ ] **Code folding incomplete** - Detection works, but text hiding not possible
- [ ] **Scroll sync imperfect** - Limited access to egui's internal scroll state
- [ ] **IME candidate box positioning** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Chinese/Japanese IME candidate window appears offset from cursor position; egui's IME support is limited
- [ ] **IME undo behavior** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Undoing during IME composition may delete an extra character; related to egui's text input handling

### Cursor Positioning Limitations
- [ ] **Click-to-edit cursor drift on mixed-format lines** - When clicking formatted text in rendered/split view, cursor may land 1-5 characters off on long lines with mixed formatting (bold + italic + links). This is due to font width differences between regular and bold text that cannot be perfectly measured without access to the actual render layout. Will be properly fixed with custom editor in v0.3.0.

### v0.2.5.1 (Released) - Memory, Encoding & Accuracy

> **Status:** Released (2026-01-17)

Point release focusing on memory optimization, multi-encoding support, cursor positioning improvements, scroll navigation accuracy, and UX polish.

#### Multi-Encoding File Support
- [x] **Encoding detection** - Auto-detect file encoding on open using `encoding_rs` + `chardetng` crates
- [x] **Common encodings** - Support Latin-1, Windows-1252, ISO-8859-x, Shift-JIS, EUC-KR, GBK, and other common encodings
- [x] **Status bar indicator** - Show detected encoding in status bar with click-to-change option
- [x] **Preserve on save** - Save files back in their original encoding (not forced UTF-8)

#### Cursor Positioning Improvements
- [x] **Galley-based click mapping** - Use egui's Galley for semi-accurate click-to-character index conversion
- [x] **Formatting marker mapping** - Map displayed text positions to raw markdown positions accounting for `**`, `*`, `` ` ``, `~~`, and `[links](url)`
- [x] **Text wrapping support** - Handle wrapped lines correctly by using actual text rect width for measurement
- [x] **Bold font measurement** - Use bold font for measurement when content starts with bold markers

#### Scroll Navigation Accuracy (Critical Fix)
- [x] **Unified scroll calculation** - Single function for all scroll-to-line operations ensuring consistent behavior across find, search-in-files, outline panel, and semantic minimap
- [x] **Fixed off-by-one errors** - Consistent 0-indexed vs 1-indexed line handling in `navigate_to_heading()` and related functions
- [x] **Fresh line height tracking** - Use actual rendered line height instead of stale/default 20.0 value
- [x] **Large file navigation** - Fixed scroll accuracy in files with 3000+ lines where targets around line 2000 could be 1000+ pixels off
- [x] **Semantic minimap highlight fix** - Fixed highlight offset when clicking outline/minimap items; uses byte offsets (matching search) instead of character offsets

> **Known Limitation:** Cursor positioning and scroll accuracy are best-effort within egui's constraints. Lines with mixed formatting may have slight drift on longer lines due to font width differences. Perfect positioning requires the custom editor widget planned for v0.3.0.

#### Internationalization
- [x] **Language selector** - Settings option to choose UI language
- [x] **Locale detection** - Auto-detect system language on first launch
- [x] **Simplified Chinese** - First community translation (thanks @sr79368142!)

#### Memory Optimization
> **Docs:** [Memory Optimization Plan](docs/technical/planning/memory-optimization.md)

Reduced ~250MB idle RAM usage to ~100-150MB:

- [x] **Fix memory leak** - Clean up `tree_viewer_states`, `csv_viewer_states`, `sync_scroll_states` when tabs close
- [x] **Custom allocator** - Add `mimalloc` (Windows) / `jemalloc` (Linux/macOS) to reduce heap fragmentation
- [x] **CJK font lazy loading** - Load CJK fonts on-demand when CJK characters detected, not at startup (saves 50-100MB for non-CJK users); granular per-language loading (Korean/Japanese/Chinese loaded independently)
- [x] **egui temp data cleanup** - Clean up stale `SyntaxHighlightCache` entries when tabs close

#### Intel Mac CPU Optimization ([#24](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/24))
> **Docs:** [CPU Issue Analysis](docs/technical/platform/intel-mac-cpu-issue-analysis.md) | [Repaint Investigation](docs/technical/platform/intel-mac-continuous-repaint-investigation.md)

Fixed 100% CPU usage on Intel Macs in Rendered mode:

- [x] **Log analysis tooling** - Created `scripts/analyze_log.py` to analyze verbose debug logs
- [x] **Removed verbose debug logging** - Eliminated `[LIST_ITEM_DEBUG]` statements generating ~2,200 log lines/second (48,850 in 22 seconds)
- [x] **Fixed continuous repaint cause** - Root cause identified: `Sense::hover()` on rendered editor's scroll area content was triggering continuous repaints (~60fps) whenever mouse moved over the area, bypassing the 100ms idle throttling. Changed to `Sense::focusable_noninteractive()` to allow proper throttling (~10fps when idle)

#### Bug Fixes & Polish
- [x] **Workspace view close button** - X button shifted left to prevent overlap with resize handles
- [x] **New file dirty flag** - Don't prompt to save new files that haven't been modified
- [x] **First-line indentation fix** - CJK paragraph indentation now only indents first line, not entire paragraph
- [x] **Session restore settings** - Added option to disable tab restoration on startup
- [x] **Linux close button** - Fixed hit-testing/overlay issue preventing close button clicks

### v0.2.5.2 (Released) - Editor Shortcuts, macOS, Linux & I18n

> **Status:** Released (2026-01-20)

Point release with new keyboard shortcuts, macOS improvements, Linux bug fixes, and internationalization cleanup.

#### New Features
- [x] **Delete Line shortcut** ([#29](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/29)) - Cmd/Ctrl+D deletes current line (configurable in settings) - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!
- [x] **Move Line Up/Down** ([#29](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/29)) - Alt+Up/Down swaps current line with adjacent lines also in split view - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!
- [x] **macOS file type associations** ([#30](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/30)) - Ferrite appears in Finder's "Open With" menu for .md, .json, .yaml, .toml, .txt files - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!

> **Note:** Opening files via "Open With" or dragging onto app icon not yet supported due to [winit#1751](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1751). Workaround: use `open -a Ferrite file.md` or File > Open.

#### Bug Fixes
- [x] **Ctrl+X cutting entire document** - Fixed egui bug where Ctrl+X with no selection would cut everything. Filter out `Event::Cut` when nothing is selected.
- [x] **Linux window drag stuck mouse** - Fixed critical bug where dragging the custom title bar on Linux caused the mouse to get "stuck" in drag mode. Bypassed egui's drag state machine using raw input detection for reliable window drag initiation.
- [x] **Split mode cursor position** ([#29](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/29)) - Line operations now work correctly in Split view; rendered pane no longer overwrites cursor position - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!
- [x] **macOS modifier tooltips** ([#28](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/28), [#29](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/29)) - Tooltips now show "Cmd+E" on macOS instead of hardcoded "Ctrl+E" - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!
- [x] **Semantic minimap highlight accuracy** - Use byte offsets matching search behavior for correct highlight positioning

#### Internationalization
- [x] **I18n audit & cleanup** - Comprehensive audit of hardcoded strings, replacement with translation keys
- [x] **Orphaned key removal** - Removed ~200 unused translation keys from locale files
- [x] **Locale file sync** - All locale files now have consistent structure matching en.yaml
- [x] **New language support** - Added Estonian and Norwegian Bokmål via Weblate community translations

### v0.2.5.3 (Released) - Syntax Themes, Code Signing, Linux Performance & UI Polish

> **Status:** Released (2026-01-24)

Point release with Windows code signing, syntax theme selector, extended language support, Linux performance fixes, and UI improvements.

#### Code Signing (Pending Approval)
> **Docs:** [SignPath Code Signing](docs/technical/platform/signpath-code-signing.md)

- [ ] **SignPath integration** - Windows artifacts (exe, MSI, portable zip) will be code signed via [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) free tier for open source (awaiting organization approval)
- [x] **CI/CD signing workflow** - Integrated signing into GitHub Actions release workflow with automatic artifact signing (ready, pending SignPath approval)

#### UI Improvements
- [x] **View Mode Segmented Control** - Replaced single-letter toggle button (R/S/V) with a polished pill-shaped segmented control showing all three view modes (Raw, Split, Rendered) at once. Click directly on the desired mode with clear visual feedback for the active state. Adapts to file type (3 modes for markdown/CSV, 2 modes for JSON/YAML/TOML). Works in Zen mode.
- [x] **App logo in title bar** - Added Ferrite logo with transparent background to the title bar for better brand visibility

#### Syntax Highlighting
- [x] **Extended syntax support** - Added 100+ additional language syntaxes via `two-face` crate, including PowerShell (.ps1/.psm1/.psd1), TypeScript/TSX, Zig, Svelte, Vue, Terraform, Nix, and many more
- [x] **Syntax theme selector** - New dropdown in Appearance settings with 25+ syntax highlighting color themes (Dracula, Nord, Catppuccin variants, Gruvbox, Solarized, One Half, GitHub, VS Code Dark+, and more)

#### Performance
- [x] **Linux folder opening freeze** - Fixed critical 10+ second UI freeze when opening workspace folders on Linux (especially Fedora/KDE Plasma). Two root causes fixed:
  - **notify crate misconfiguration** - Was configured with `default-features = false, features = ["macos_kqueue"]` which disabled inotify on Linux, forcing fallback to slow polling-based file watching
  - **Synchronous recursive scanning** - Workspace initialization scanned entire directory tree on UI thread. Now uses lazy loading: only root is scanned initially, subdirectories load on-demand when expanded

#### Flathub Distribution
- [x] **Flathub submission** - Desktop entry and AppStream metainfo files for Flathub packaging at `assets/linux/`

#### Bug Fixes
- [x] **Line breaks in list items** ([#41](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/41)) - Fixed hard line breaks (`\` at end of line) within list items showing as a square box instead of rendering as a line break
- [x] **Git deleted file icon rendering** - Fixed git "deleted" status icon showing as a square box in file tree. Changed from unsupported Unicode character to ASCII minus.
- [x] **Blockquote/table overflow** - Added horizontal scrolling for tables and blockquotes when content exceeds container width. Wide content no longer breaks max line width for subsequent content. Code blocks and mermaid diagrams already have internal scroll handling.
- [x] **PowerShell file rendering collapse** - Fixed critical bug where PowerShell and other files without syntax definitions would collapse all content to a single line
- [x] **Alt-tab/taskbar visibility on Wayland** - Fixed Ferrite window not appearing in alt-tab switcher or taskbar on Linux desktop environments (KDE Plasma, GNOME) running Wayland. Added `app_id` to ViewportBuilder.
- [x] **Find/Replace replace icon** - Fixed the replace icon (↳) showing as a square box in the Find and Replace panel. Changed to universally-supported arrow (→).
- [x] **Tree viewer context menu icon** - Fixed the context menu button (⋯) in JSON/YAML/TOML tree viewer showing as a square. Changed to simple dots (...).
- [x] **Recent files menu position** - Fixed the recent files/folders popup menu appearing below and covering the filename button in the status bar. Menu now appears above the button.

### v0.2.6 (Planned) - Custom Text Editor & Memory Fix (Critical)

> **Status:** In Progress
> **Docs:** [Custom Editor Plan](docs/technical/planning/custom-editor-widget-plan.md)

**v0.2.6 is a focused release addressing the critical large file memory issue** ([#45](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/45)). The root cause is egui's TextEdit widget, which creates massive Galley structures (~500MB for a 4MB file). The only solution is replacing egui's TextEdit with a custom editor that uses virtual scrolling.

#### Memory Optimization (Done) ([#45](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/45))
> **Issue:** Opening a 4MB text file caused 1.8GB RAM usage and laggy editor

Rust-side optimizations completed (reduces Ferrite's allocations from ~400MB to ~44MB for 4MB files):

- [x] **Editor per-frame clone fix** - Eliminated 240MB/second allocation from cloning content every frame. Now uses lazy undo snapshot pattern.
- [x] **Search allocation fix** - Case-insensitive search no longer allocates full document copy. Uses regex with `(?i)` flag.
- [x] **Search debouncing** - 150ms debounce prevents search on every keystroke.
- [x] **Large file detection** - Files > 1MB get special memory treatment:
  - Hash-based modification detection instead of full content clone
  - Clear original_bytes after load (saves 4MB per 4MB file)
  - Reduced undo stack (10 entries instead of 100)

> **Remaining issue:** egui's TextEdit still creates massive Galley structures (~500MB for 4MB file). This requires the custom editor below.

#### Custom Text Editor (Critical Priority)
> **Why this is critical:** egui's TextEdit is fundamentally incompatible with large files. It lays out ALL text upfront, storing glyphs and positions for every character. For a 4MB file, this alone uses ~500MB-1GB of RAM. No amount of optimization on Ferrite's side can fix this — we must replace the underlying text widget.

Replace egui's `TextEdit` with a custom `FerriteEditor` widget:

- [ ] **FerriteEditor widget** - Custom text editor using egui drawing primitives
- [ ] **Virtual scrolling** - Only render and layout visible lines + small buffer
- [ ] **Rope-based buffer** - Efficient text storage via `ropey` crate for O(log n) operations
- [ ] **Line-based rendering** - Layout one line at a time, cache visible lines only
- [ ] **Lazy galley creation** - Create Galley objects only for visible content
- [ ] **Syntax highlighting integration** - Per-line highlighting with visible-only processing
- [ ] **Scroll position management** - Track scroll by line number, not pixel offset

> **Memory target:** A 4MB file should use ~10-20MB total (content + visible galleys), not 500MB+.

#### Additional Features (If Time Permits)
These become possible with the custom editor:

- [ ] **Full multi-cursor editing** - Text operations at all cursor positions (blocked by egui TextEdit)
- [ ] **Code folding with text hiding** - Actually collapse regions visually (blocked by egui TextEdit)
- [ ] **Pixel-perfect scroll positioning** - Use actual galley coordinates for perfect navigation

#### Code Signing
- [ ] **SignPath organization approval** - Awaiting SignPath.io approval for code signing
- [ ] **Windows artifacts signing** - exe, MSI, portable zip will be signed once approved

---

- [ ] **LRU row cache** - Cache recently parsed rows (max ~10K rows) for smooth scrolling
- [ ] **Background CSV scanning** - Scan file in background thread with progress indicator

#### Flowchart Refactoring
- [ ] **Modular refactor** - Split the 3500+ line `flowchart.rs` into smaller, maintainable modules (parser, layout, renderer, shapes, edges)
- [ ] **Code cleanup** - Improve code organization, reduce duplication, add documentation

#### Mermaid Improvements
- [ ] **Testing & validation** - Comprehensive testing of all diagram types with edge cases
- [ ] **Bug fixes** - Address rendering issues discovered during v0.2.5 testing

#### Bug Fixes & Polish
- [ ] **Table overflow UX improvement** - Cell word-wrap by default, thin hover-visible scrollbar for truly wide tables
- [ ] **macOS Intel sync scrolling** ([#24](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/24)) - Bidirectional scroll sync on Intel Macs
- [ ] **macOS window controls** ([#24](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/24)) - Native traffic light style
- [ ] **Window controls redesign** - Redesign minimize/maximize/close icons
- [ ] **JSON rendered view Zen mode centering** - JSON tree viewer not centering in Zen mode
- [ ] **TOC navigation stability** - Fix crashes when jumping via outline in large files
- [ ] **Light theme settings contrast** - Fix dark foreground colors in light theme

#### Vim Mode
- [ ] **Vim keybindings** - Optional Vim-style modal editing (Normal/Insert/Visual modes)

#### Internationalization Polish
- [ ] **Expand i18n coverage** - Add translation keys for keyboard shortcuts panel, JSON structure panel, ribbon tooltips
- [ ] **HTML export i18n** - Include CJK paragraph indentation in exported HTML

#### Portable Mode
- [ ] **Portable mode support** - Detect `ferrite.portable` marker file; store config in local `data/` folder

#### Executable Code Blocks
Run code snippets directly in the rendered preview — inspired by Jupyter notebooks.

- [ ] **Run button on code blocks** - Add "▶ Run" button to fenced code blocks
- [ ] **Shell/Bash execution** - Execute shell scripts via `std::process::Command`
- [ ] **Python support** - Detect `python` or `python3` and run with system interpreter
- [ ] **Timeout handling** - Kill long-running scripts after configurable timeout (default 30s)
- [ ] **Security warning** - First-run dialog warning about code execution risks

> **Security Note:** Code execution is opt-in and disabled by default.

#### Content Blocks / Callouts

- [ ] **`<table>` (HTML tables)** - Render HTML table syntax

> **Note:** Only safe HTML elements supported — no `<script>`, `<style>`, `<iframe>`.

#### 5. Platform & Distribution

##### Windows Installer
- [ ] **Inno Setup installer** - Professional `.exe` installer
- [ ] **File associations** - Register as handler for `.md`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.toml` files
- [ ] **Context menu integration** - "Open with Ferrite" for files and folders
- [ ] **Add to PATH option** - Run `ferrite` from any terminal

##### macOS
- [ ] **App signing & notarization** - Create proper `.app` bundle, sign with Developer ID

### v0.4.0 (Planned) - Math Support & Document Formats

> **Status:** Planning  
> **Docs:** [Math Support Plan](docs/math-support-plan.md)

Native LaTeX math rendering and read-only support for Office documents. Focus on the most impactful features first.

#### Math Rendering Engine
- [ ] **LaTeX parser** - Parse `$...$` (inline) and `$$...$$` (display) syntax
- [ ] **Layout engine** - TeX-style box model for fractions, subscripts, radicals
- [ ] **Math fonts** - Embedded glyph subset for consistent cross-platform rendering
- [ ] **egui integration** - Render math in preview and split views

#### Supported LaTeX (Target)
- [ ] **Fractions** - `\frac{a}{b}` with proper stacking
- [ ] **Subscripts/superscripts** - `x^2`, `x_i`, `x_i^2`
- [ ] **Greek letters** - `\alpha`, `\beta`, `\pi`, etc.
- [ ] **Operators** - `\sum`, `\int`, `\prod`, `\lim`
- [ ] **Roots** - `\sqrt{x}`, `\sqrt[n]{x}`
- [ ] **Delimiters** - Auto-scaling `\left( \right)`
- [ ] **Matrices** - `\begin{matrix}...\end{matrix}`
- [ ] **Font styles** - `\mathbf`, `\mathit`, `\mathrm`

#### WYSIWYG Features (Requires FerriteEditor from v0.3.0)
- [ ] **Inline math preview** - See rendered math while typing (Typora-style)
- [ ] **Click-to-edit** - Click rendered math to edit source
- [ ] **Symbol palette** - Quick access to common symbols

#### Office Document Support (Read-Only)
View Word and Excel documents without traditional page layouts — modern "page-less" document viewing.

> **Philosophy:** Word's page-based layout is a holdover from print. Ferrite displays Office documents as flowing, readable content — like a modern web reader.

##### DOCX Support (Word Documents)
- [ ] **DOCX file opening** - Open `.docx` files via File → Open and drag-drop
- [ ] **Page-less rendering** - Display Word content as continuous flowing text (no page breaks)
- [ ] **Text extraction** - Headings, paragraphs, lists, bold/italic formatting
- [ ] **Table rendering** - Display Word tables using existing table renderer
- [ ] **Image support** - Extract and display embedded images
- [ ] **Export to Markdown** - Convert DOCX → Markdown for editing (lossy conversion with warnings)

##### XLSX Support (Excel Spreadsheets)
- [ ] **XLSX file opening** - Open `.xlsx` files via File → Open and drag-drop
- [ ] **Sheet selector** - Tab bar or dropdown to switch between worksheets
- [ ] **Table rendering** - Reuse CSV viewer with rainbow columns, header detection
- [ ] **Cell formatting** - Preserve basic number/date formatting where possible
- [ ] **Large sheet handling** - Lazy row loading for sheets with 10K+ rows (reuse v0.2.6 lazy CSV infrastructure)

> **Technical Notes:**
> - DOCX/XLSX are open standards (ECMA-376/ISO 29500) — no licensing concerns
> - Rust crates: `calamine` (Excel), `docx-rs` or `quick-xml` (Word)
> - Read-only initially; editing would require significant additional work
> - Complex formatting (tracked changes, comments, macros) out of scope for v0.4.0

##### OpenDocument Support (LibreOffice)
- [ ] **ODT file opening** - Open `.odt` (Writer) files with same approach as DOCX
- [ ] **ODS file opening** - Open `.ods` (Calc) files with same approach as XLSX
- [ ] **Shared rendering** - Reuse DOCX/XLSX renderers (both are XML-in-ZIP formats)

---

### Future (v0.5.0+)

> **Note:** Features in this section are ideas under consideration. We haven't fully decided which to implement — some may be deferred, modified, or not implemented at all based on user feedback and development priorities.

#### Core Improvements
- [ ] **Memory-mapped file I/O** ([#19](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/19)) - Handle GB-scale CSV/JSON files efficiently without loading into RAM
- [ ] **TODO list editing UX** - Smart cursor behavior in task lists (respect line start position, don't jump past `- [ ]` syntax)
- [ ] **Spell checking** - Integrated spell check with custom dictionaries
- [ ] **Custom themes** - Import/export theme files
- [ ] **Virtual/ghost text** - AI completions, suggestions, etc.
- [ ] **Column/box selection** - Rectangular text selection

#### Additional Document Formats (Candidates)
These formats are under consideration based on user demand:

##### Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
- [ ] **Notebook file opening** - Open `.ipynb` files (JSON-based format)
- [ ] **Cell rendering** - Display markdown cells rendered, code cells with syntax highlighting
- [ ] **Output display** - Show cell outputs (text, images, tables)
- [ ] **Read-only initially** - View notebooks; editing deferred

> Extremely popular in data science. JSON-based format is relatively straightforward to parse.

##### EPUB (E-Books)
- [ ] **EPUB file opening** - Open `.epub` files for distraction-free reading
- [ ] **Chapter navigation** - Outline panel shows table of contents
- [ ] **Page-less reading** - Continuous scroll through book content
- [ ] **Reading position** - Remember last position in book

> EPUB is HTML+CSS in a ZIP — fits Ferrite's "page-less document" vision.

##### LaTeX Source Files (.tex)
- [ ] **TeX file opening** - Open `.tex` files with syntax highlighting
- [ ] **Math preview** - Render `$...$` and `$$...$$` blocks inline (requires v0.4.0 Math Engine)
- [ ] **Section outline** - Extract `\section`, `\subsection` for outline panel
- [ ] **BibTeX support** - Basic `.bib` file viewing

#### Alternative Markup Languages ([#21](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/21))
Support for markup languages beyond Markdown. Implementation approach TBD (native parser vs plugin system).

- [ ] **reStructuredText** (.rst) - Python documentation standard; rendered preview like Markdown
- [ ] **Org-mode** (.org) - Emacs org-mode format; plain-text productivity (basic support only)
- [ ] **AsciiDoc** - Technical documentation format
- [ ] **Zim-Wiki** - Zim Desktop Wiki syntax
- [ ] **Format auto-detection** - Detect markup format from file extension or content

### Long-Term Vision

#### Plugin System
Extensibility architecture for custom functionality, inspired by Obsidian's plugin ecosystem.

- [ ] **Plugin API design** - Define extension points (commands, views, file handlers)
- [ ] **Scripting support** - Lua, WASM, or Rhai-based plugins
- [ ] **Community plugins** - Distribution and discovery mechanism

#### Headless Editor Library
Extract `FerriteEditor` as a standalone, framework-agnostic text editing library for the Rust ecosystem.

> **Context:** There's currently no general-purpose "headless" code editor library in Rust. Existing implementations (egui's TextEdit, Lapce/Floem, Zed/gpui) are tightly coupled to their UI frameworks. The v0.3.0 custom editor and modular architecture lay the groundwork for potential extraction.

**Prerequisites (from v0.3.0):**
- Custom `FerriteEditor` widget with rope-based buffer
- Modular architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Framework-agnostic core logic

**Extraction would involve:**
- [ ] Abstract rendering backend (trait-based: egui, wgpu, vello, SVG, etc.)
- [ ] Framework-agnostic input handling
- [ ] Standalone crate with minimal dependencies
- [ ] Integration with [Parley](https://github.com/linebender/parley) for advanced text layout/shaping (optional)
