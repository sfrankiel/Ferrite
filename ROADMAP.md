# Ferrite Roadmap

## Next Up (Immediate Focus)

### v0.2.7 (Planned) - Performance, Features & Polish
**Focus:** Features moved from v0.2.6 to allow focus on the text editor, plus checking for updates.

#### Bug Fixes & UX
- [x] **CJK fonts load on language switch** - Switching to Chinese or Japanese in the Welcome panel now lazily loads the required CJK font so translated UI labels render correctly instead of showing squares. Uses `Language::required_cjk_font()` to map language → `CjkFontPreference` and `preload_explicit_cjk_font()` to load only the single needed font (~15-20MB).
- [x] **Latin-only names in Language and CJK preference selectors** - Language selector (Settings → Appearance) and CJK Regional Preference (Settings → Editor) used native script (e.g. 简体中文, 日本語, 한국어), which rendered as squares when CJK fonts were not yet loaded (lazy loading). Both dropdowns now use Latin-only display names (e.g. "Chinese (Simplified)", "Japanese", "Korean (Hangul)") so they are always legible without preloading CJK fonts.
- [x] **View mode bar on unsupported file types** - When default view is Split and user opens a file that doesn't support split (e.g. .rs), the view mode bar is hidden so mode can only be changed via hotkeys. Always show the view mode bar: for non–split-supported files use the two-mode segment (Raw | Rendered) so users can switch without hotkeys.
- [x] **Open file in current window as tab** - Single-instance protocol: double-clicking files (file tree or OS/Explorer) opens them as tabs in the existing Ferrite window instead of spawning a new process. Lock file + TCP IPC with background accept thread for instant response (<50ms end-to-end). Early instance check in main() before config/icon loading; `ctx.request_repaint()` wakeup bypasses idle intervals.
- [x] **Images not displaying in rendered mode** - Markdown image syntax `![](path)` now shows images in rendered/split view; path resolution (relative to document dir + workspace root), image loading/caching via `image` crate (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP), scaled rendering with aspect ratio, graceful placeholders for missing/unsupported files.
- [x] **CJK rendering after restart with explicit preference** ([#76](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/76)) - When "Which CJK font to prioritize" is set to a non-Auto value and the app restarts, Chinese can render as tofu in restored tabs because we only lazy-load CJK for the active tab and don't preload the user's preferred font at startup. Fix: preload the single preferred CJK font at startup when preference is explicit (same approach as Auto + system locale), so restored documents render correctly regardless of which tab is active.
- [x] **Syntax highlighting per-frame re-parsing** - `highlight_line()` was called on every frame for every visible line *before* checking the galley cache, causing severe lag on files with long lines (e.g. dense markdown with inline formatting). Fixed by checking the cache first and only running syntect regex parsing on cache misses.
- [x] **Scrollbar position incorrect with word wrap** - Scrollbar thumb position was calculated using uniform `first_visible_line * line_height`, ignoring actual wrapped line heights. Fixed to use cumulative y-offsets from the height cache, so the scrollbar accurately reflects scroll position and reaches the bottom.
- [x] **Scrollbar drag used wrong reverse mapping** - Dragging the scrollbar converted pixel position to a line number using uniform division, causing inaccurate jumps with word wrap. Fixed to use `y_offset_to_line()` binary search with sub-line precision.
- [x] **Scrollbar jumping as new wrap info discovered** - `rebuild_height_cache` ran every frame (O(N)) and `total_content_height` changed abruptly as previously-unseen wrapped lines were measured during scrolling. Fixed with a dirty flag (only rebuild when wrap info changes) and smoothed scrollbar height that lerps toward the actual value.
- [x] **Crash on large selection delete with word wrap** - Selecting a large block of text top-down and pressing Backspace caused an instant crash (`capacity overflow` panic). Root cause: after deletion, `first_visible_line` remained past the now-shorter document due to stale `wrap_info`/`cumulative_heights`, causing `get_visible_line_range()` to return `start > end` and `Vec::with_capacity(end - start)` to underflow. Fixed with 4 layers: (1) `saturating_sub` on the Vec allocation, (2) hard-clamp `first_visible_line` to `total_lines-1` in `clamp_scroll_position`, (3) clamp `cursor_to_char_pos` result to `buffer.len()`, (4) new `truncate_wrap_info()` to trim stale entries instead of full-clearing (avoids flickering).
- [ ] **Wrapped line scroll stuttering** - Scrolling through documents with many word-wrapped lines still shows micro-stuttering. Likely related to per-line galley layout cost or height cache granularity. Needs further investigation.
- [x] **Light mode text invisible** - All `RichText::strong()` section headers in Settings, Terminal, and other panels were invisible in light mode. Root cause: egui's `strong_text_color()` returns `widgets.active.fg_stroke.color` (set to WHITE for pressed buttons), bypassing `override_text_color`. Fixed by using primary text color for `active.fg_stroke` in light theme.
- [ ] **General Bug Fixes** - Addressing additional issues reported post-v0.2.6.1 release.

#### Markdown Linking
- [x] **Wikilinks support** ([#1](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/1)) - `[[target]]` and `[[target|display]]` syntax with relative path resolution, spaces in filenames, click-to-navigate, ambiguity handling.
- [x] **Backlinks panel** - Panel showing files linking to current file; graph-based indexing for large workspaces; click-to-navigate.

#### Editing Modes
- [x] **Vim Mode** - Optional Vim-style modal editing (Normal / Insert / Visual modes). Essential commands: hjkl, dd, yy, p, /search, v/V selection. Mode indicator in status bar. Toggle in Settings → Editor.

#### Check for Updates
- [x] **Check for Updates button** - Settings → About section with button that checks GitHub Releases API and shows result inline (up-to-date, update available with link, or error). Uses `ureq` (lightweight blocking HTTP) on a background thread with `mpsc` channel for non-blocking UI.
- [x] **Manual Trigger Only** - No automatic or background checking. Strictly user-initiated (offline-first philosophy).
- [x] **Security hardening** - Response URL validated against `https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/releases/` prefix; malformed URLs are replaced with a constructed safe URL. TLS via `rustls` (pure Rust, no OpenSSL).

#### Large File Performance
- [x] **Large file detection** - Auto-detect files > 10MB on open, show warning toast.
- [x] **Lazy CSV row parsing** - Byte-offset row index (`Vec<u64>`) built on CSV load; only visible rows parsed on demand with viewport caching. Reduces additional memory from ~100-200MB to ~8MB for 1M-row files. Small files (<1MB) now cached instead of re-parsed every frame. Note: files >50MB still bottleneck on initial file I/O and string allocation — memory-mapped I/O is planned for v0.4+.

#### Welcome View
- [x] **Welcome view on first run** - Welcome tab on first launch with configuration for theme, language, editor settings (word wrap, line numbers, minimap, bracket matching, syntax highlighting), max line width, CJK font preference, and auto-save. Only shown when no CLI paths and no session-restored tabs. Contributed by [@blizzard007dev](https://github.com/blizzard007dev) ([PR #80](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/80)).

#### Installer & Localization
- [x] **Windows MSI installer overhaul** - Complete installer rewrite with WixUI_FeatureTree: optional file associations (.md, .txt, .json, .yaml, .toml, .csv) via OpenWithProgids with per-extension toggles, Explorer context menu ("Open with Ferrite" on files and folders), optional add-to-PATH, desktop shortcut, Windows Default Apps registration (ApplicationCapabilities), and launch-after-install checkbox. All features user-selectable; no forced associations.
- [x] **German and Japanese in Settings** - German (Deutsch) and Japanese (日本語) now available in Settings → Appearance → Language.

#### UI Declutter & Edge Toggles
- [ ] **Move format toolbar to editor bottom** - Markdown formatting buttons (bold, italic, code, headings, lists, etc.) moved from the ribbon to a collapsible toolbar at the bottom of the raw editor area. Visible in Raw and Split modes for markdown files. Collapse/expand via chevron toggle. Reduces ribbon clutter significantly.
- [ ] **Side panel toggle strip** - Replaced separate Outline and Productivity Hub ribbon buttons with a thin toggle strip on the right edge of the editor. Click to open/close the side panel (which contains Outline, Statistics, Backlinks, and Productivity Hub tabs). Consistent UX pattern with the bottom format toolbar.
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts preserved** - All existing keyboard shortcuts for formatting, outline toggle, and productivity hub continue to work.

#### Refactoring & Quality
- [x] **Flowchart Refactoring** - Modularized 3600-line `flowchart.rs` into 12 focused modules: `flowchart/types.rs`, `parser.rs`, `layout/` (config, graph, subgraph, sugiyama), `render/` (colors, nodes, edges, subgraphs), `utils.rs`.
- [x] **Window Controls** - Redesigned Close, Minimize, Maximize/Restore, and Fullscreen buttons: crisp manually-painted icons (line segments), rounded hover backgrounds (4 px radius), compact size (36 × 22 px). Fixed fullscreen icon (was rendering as ×, now uses proper corner-bracket expand/compress symbols). Re-enabled NE corner resize — 12 px right margin keeps the corner grab zone button-free. `TITLE_BAR_BUTTON_RIGHT_MARGIN` constant documents the sizing invariant in `window.rs`.

#### Unicode & Complex Script Support (Phase 1: Font Loading)
- [ ] **Lazy font loading for complex scripts** - Extend the existing CJK lazy-loading system to cover Arabic, Bengali, Devanagari, Thai, Hebrew, Tamil, and other non-Latin scripts. Detect Unicode ranges on file open/paste and load matching system fonts on demand (Noto Sans Arabic, Noto Sans Bengali, etc.). Same pattern as CJK: atomic load flags, system font candidates per script, font family fallback chain.
- [ ] **Script detection utility** - `detect_complex_scripts()` function analogous to `detect_cjk_scripts()`, covering Unicode blocks for Arabic (`U+0600–U+06FF`), Bengali (`U+0980–U+09FF`), Devanagari (`U+0900–U+097F`), Thai (`U+0E00–U+0E7F`), Hebrew (`U+0590–U+05FF`), Tamil (`U+0B80–U+0BFF`), and others.
- [ ] **Settings UI for script preferences** - Extend the CJK font preference dropdown or add a new "Additional Scripts" section so users can pre-select fonts for their language.

*Note: Phase 1 provides correct glyph display for scripts that don't require complex shaping (Hebrew, Thai, Cyrillic extended) and partial display for scripts that do (Arabic, Bengali show individual glyphs without ligature/contextual shaping). Full shaping requires Phase 2 (v0.2.8). See [research notes](docs/technical/editor/unicode-complex-scripts.md).*

#### Executable Code Blocks *(deferred to v0.2.8+)*
- [ ] **Run button on code blocks** - Add `▶ Run` button to fenced code blocks.
- [ ] **Shell / Bash execution** - Execute shell snippets via `std::process::Command`.
- [ ] **Python support** - Detect `python` / `python3` and run with system interpreter.
- [ ] **Timeout handling** - Kill long-running scripts after configurable timeout (default: 30s).
- [ ] **Security warning** - First-run dialog explaining execution risks.  
  *Security note: Code execution is opt‑in and disabled by default.*

#### Content Blocks / Callouts
- [x] **GitHub-style callouts** - Support `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`.
- [x] **Custom titles** - `> [!NOTE] Custom Title`.
- [x] **Styled rendering** - Color-coded blocks with icons in rendered view.
- [x] **Collapsible callouts** - `> [!NOTE]-` syntax for collapsed-by-default blocks.

## Known Issues 

### FerriteEditor Limitations
With the v0.2.6 custom editor, most previous egui TextEdit limitations are resolved. Remaining issues:

- [ ] **IME candidate box positioning** ([#15](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/15)) - Chinese/Japanese IME candidate window may appear offset from cursor position.

### Deferred to v0.2.7
- [ ] **Bidirectional scroll sync** - Editor-Preview scroll synchronization in Split view. Requires deeper investigation into viewport-based line tracking.

### Rendered View Limitations
- [ ] **Click-to-edit cursor drift on mixed-format lines** - When clicking formatted text in rendered/split view, cursor may land 1-5 characters off on long lines with mixed formatting.

---

## Planned Features 

### v0.2.8 - UI, Accessibility & Text Shaping

#### Unicode & Complex Script Support (Phase 2: Text Shaping Engine)
*Depends on: Phase 1 font loading from v0.2.7*

- [ ] **HarfRust integration for FerriteEditor** - Integrate [HarfRust](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfrust) (pure-Rust HarfBuzz port, v0.5.0+) into the FerriteEditor rendering pipeline for production-quality text shaping. Converts Unicode codepoint sequences into correctly positioned, contextually-formed glyphs for all scripts including Arabic (contextual forms: initial/medial/final/isolated), Bengali (conjunct consonants, vowel reordering), Devanagari, Tamil, and other Indic scripts.
- [ ] **Shaped galley cache** - Extend `LineCache` to store shaped text runs (glyph IDs + positions) instead of raw character galleys. Invalidation on content change, font change, or viewport resize.
- [ ] **Grapheme-cluster-aware cursor** - Replace character-based cursor movement with grapheme-cluster-aware navigation using `unicode-segmentation`. A single visual "character" in Bengali or Arabic may span multiple Unicode codepoints — cursor must step over the entire cluster.
- [ ] **Shaped text measurement** - Update word wrap, line width calculation, and scroll offset computation to use shaped advance widths instead of per-character metrics.

*Note: Phase 2 provides correct rendering of all complex scripts in the Raw editor (FerriteEditor). Text direction remains LTR — Arabic/Hebrew text will be shaped correctly (ligatures, contextual forms) but displayed left-to-right. Full RTL layout requires Phase 3 (v0.3.0). WYSIWYG/rendered view inherits egui's text pipeline and will not benefit until egui itself adds shaping support or Phase 4.*

*Background: egui (as of 0.33) uses `ab_glyph` which does glyph-by-glyph rendering with no shaping. PR [#5784](https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/5784) to integrate Parley is stalled (Nov 2025). We cannot wait for upstream — HarfRust integration in our custom editor widget is the pragmatic path.*

#### LSP Integration (Language Server Protocol)
*Plan: [docs/lsp-integration-plan.md](docs/lsp-integration-plan.md)*

- [ ] **Phase 1: Infrastructure** — Auto-detect language server by file extension; spawn server as child process via stdio on workspace open; graceful fallback with dismissable notification if not installed; server lifecycle (start, restart on crash, shutdown on close); LSP toggle per workspace (opt-in, off by default); status bar indicator (ready / indexing / not found).
- [ ] **Phase 2: Inline diagnostics** — Error/warning squiggles under text with hover tooltip; incremental document sync (changed ranges only); diagnostic count in status bar (e.g. 2 errors, 1 warning).
- [ ] **Phase 3: Hover & Go to Definition** — Hover documentation with configurable delay; Go to Definition (F12 or Ctrl+Click).
- [ ] **Phase 4: Autocomplete** — Completion popup on typing or Ctrl+Space, debounced (e.g. 150ms), navigable with arrow keys; request cancellation for stale completions.
- [ ] **Settings** — Per-language server path override; all processing local (no network calls).

#### Traditional Menu Bar ([#59](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/59))
- [ ] **Alt-key menu access** - Traditional File/Edit/View menus toggled via Alt key (VS Code style).
- [ ] **Accessibility** - Full keyboard navigation for all menu items.

#### Additional Format Support

##### XML Tree Viewer
- [ ] **XML file support** - Open `.xml` files with syntax highlighting.
- [ ] **Tree view** - Reuse JSON/YAML tree viewer for hierarchical XML display.
- [ ] **Attribute display** - Show element attributes in tree nodes.

##### Configuration Files
- [ ] **INI / CONF / CFG support** - Parse and display `.ini`, `.conf`, `.cfg` files.
- [ ] **Java properties files** - Support for `.properties` files.
- [ ] **ENV files** - `.env` file support with optional secret masking.

##### Log File Viewing
- [ ] **Log file detection** - Recognize `.log` files and common log formats.
- [ ] **Level highlighting** - Color-code `ERROR`, `WARN`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`.
- [ ] **Timestamp recognition** - Highlight ISO timestamps and common date formats.

### v0.3.0 - Mermaid Crate, Markdown Enhancements & Full RTL/BiDi
**Focus:** Extracting the Mermaid renderer as a standalone crate, improving markdown rendering, and completing right-to-left and bidirectional text support.

#### 0. Unicode & Complex Script Support (Phase 3 & 4: RTL, BiDi, WYSIWYG)
*Depends on: Phase 2 text shaping from v0.2.8*

**Phase 3: Right-to-Left Layout & Bidirectional Text**
- [ ] **RTL text layout in FerriteEditor** - Render Arabic, Hebrew, and other RTL scripts right-to-left within lines. Shaped glyph runs are placed from the right edge; line alignment respects detected paragraph direction.
- [ ] **Unicode BiDi algorithm** - Implement the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UAX #9) via the `unicode-bidi` crate for mixed-direction text (e.g., English embedded in Arabic). Resolves embedding levels, reorders glyph runs per line, and handles directional isolates/overrides.
- [ ] **RTL cursor navigation** - Arrow keys move in visual order (left arrow moves left visually, regardless of text direction). Home/End respect paragraph direction. Selection handles disjoint byte ranges in BiDi text.
- [ ] **RTL selection rendering** - Selection highlighting for BiDi text may produce multiple visual rectangles per logical selection range. Click-to-position respects visual glyph boundaries.
- [ ] **RTL line wrapping** - Word wrap respects script direction. Break opportunities follow UAX #14 (Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm) for correct behavior with Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, and other scripts.

**Phase 4: WYSIWYG & UI Chrome**
- [ ] **Shaped text in WYSIWYG editor** - Integrate text shaping into the rendered markdown view (`markdown/editor.rs`). RichText labels use shaped runs for correct Arabic/Bengali rendering in headings, paragraphs, lists, and tables.
- [ ] **Shaped text in Mermaid diagrams** - Update `TextMeasurer` to use shaped advance widths so diagram node labels render complex scripts correctly.
- [ ] **UI label shaping** - If egui has native shaping by this point (via Parley or direct HarfRust integration), adopt it. Otherwise, provide a shaping wrapper for critical UI surfaces (file tree, outline panel, status bar) where non-Latin file/heading names appear.

*Note: Full RTL+BiDi is one of the hardest problems in text editing. This phase has high risk in cursor positioning, selection handling, and find/replace with mixed-direction text. Thorough testing with real Arabic, Hebrew, and Bengali content is essential.*
