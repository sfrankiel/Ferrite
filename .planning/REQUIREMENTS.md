- [ ] Terminal error → AI context (auto-detect errors, suggest fix)
- [ ] Codebase-wide AI context (multiple files)

### Productivity Enhancements
- [ ] Git branch → task creation
- [ ] Pomodoro time tracking per task
- [ ] Session summary generation

### Database Enhancements
- [ ] PostgreSQL support
- [ ] MySQL support
- [ ] Query autocomplete

### Terminal Enhancements
- [ ] AI command generation (natural language → shell)
- [ ] Block-based terminal output

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud sync | Adds complexity, privacy concerns |
| Collaboration | Not a team tool, focus on individual |
| Calendar integration | Scope creep |
| Visual query builder | Complex UI, SQL editor is sufficient |
| ER diagram designer | Feature bloat |
| NoSQL databases | Different paradigm, defer |
| Multiple AI extensions | Conflicts, single unified panel |
| Built-in SFTP/FTP | Use terminal commands |
| Session recording playback | Storage-heavy |

---

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Success Criteria |
|-------------|-------|------------------|
| INFRA-01..04 | 6 | Workers run without blocking UI |
| PROD-01..07 | 7 | Tasks and notes persist, timer works |
| AI-01..07 | 8 | Streaming chat works with 3 providers |
| TERM-01..06 | 9 | History search and SSH connect work |
| DB-01..08 | 10 | SQLite browse, query, export works |
| INT-01..04 | 11 | All panels accessible, no regressions |

---

## Quality Gates

| Metric | Minimum | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| UI frame time | <32ms | <16ms |
| Binary size increase | <10MB | <5MB |
| Memory increase (all panels) | <100MB | <50MB |
| Startup time increase | <500ms | <200ms |
| Existing feature regressions | 0 | 0 |
| Test coverage (new code) | 60% | 80% |
