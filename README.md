A fast, lightweight text editor for Markdown, JSON, YAML, and TOML files. Built with Rust and egui for a native, responsive experience.

> ⚠️ **Platform Note:** Ferrite has been primarily developed and tested on **Windows**. While it should work on Linux and macOS, these platforms have not been extensively tested. If you encounter issues, please [report them](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues).

> 🤖 **AI Disclosure:** This project is 100% AI-generated code. All Rust code, documentation, and configuration was written by Claude (Anthropic) via [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with MCP tools. My role is product direction, testing, and learning to orchestrate AI-assisted development effectively. The code is reviewed and tested, not blindly accepted — but I want to be transparent about the development process. This project is partly a learning exercise in exploring how far AI-assisted development can go.
