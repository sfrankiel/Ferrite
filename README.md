**[getferrite.dev](https://getferrite.dev)** — Official website with downloads, features, and documentation

</div>

A fast, lightweight text editor for Markdown, JSON, YAML, and TOML files. Built with Rust and egui for a native, responsive experience.

> ⚠️ **Platform Note:** Ferrite is developed and tested on **Windows** and **Linux**. macOS support is experimental. If you encounter issues, please [report them](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues).

<details>
<summary><strong>🛡️ Code Signing & Antivirus</strong></summary>

Starting with v0.2.6.1, **all Windows releases are digitally signed** with a certificate from [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org). This means:

- **Windows SmartScreen** recognizes the publisher — no more "Unknown publisher" warnings
- **Antivirus false positives** are significantly reduced thanks to the trusted code signature
- **Integrity verification** — you can verify that the binary hasn't been tampered with

### Previous False Positives
Older unsigned builds may still trigger antivirus detections. This was caused by:
- **Live Pipeline feature**: Uses `cmd.exe /C` on Windows for shell commands, which ML-based detection can misidentify
- **Rust compilation patterns**: Rust binaries can trigger heuristic detections due to unique characteristics

We've addressed this through code signing, build profile adjustments (disabled symbol stripping, speed optimization), and reporting to Microsoft's Security Intelligence portal.

### If You're Still Affected
If Windows Defender quarantines Ferrite:
1. **Upgrade**: Download the latest signed release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/releases)
2. **Verify the signature**: Right-click `ferrite.exe` → Properties → Digital Signatures → should show "SignPath Foundation"
3. **Check VirusTotal**: Upload the file to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) — signed builds should show clean results

Ferrite does **NOT** access passwords, browser data, or make network connections. The application is fully offline and only accesses files you explicitly open.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development

This project is 100% AI-generated code. All Rust code, documentation, and configuration was written by Claude (Anthropic) via [Cursor](https://cursor.com) with MCP tools.

<details>
<summary><strong>About the AI workflow</strong></summary>

### My Role
- **Product direction** — Deciding what to build and why
- **Testing** — Running the app, finding bugs, verifying features
- **Review** — Reading generated code, understanding what it does
- **Orchestration** — Managing the AI workflow effectively

### The Workflow
1. **Idea refinement** — Discuss concepts with multiple AIs (Claude, Perplexity, Gemini Pro)
2. **PRD creation** — Generate requirements using [Task Master](https://github.com/task-master-ai/task-master)
3. **Task execution** — Claude Opus handles implementation (preferring larger tasks over many subtasks)
4. **Session handover** — Structured prompts maintain context between sessions
5. **Human review** — Every handover is reviewed; direction adjustments made as needed

📖 **Full details:** [AI Development Workflow](docs/ai-workflow/ai-development-workflow.md)

### Open Process
The actual prompts and documents used to build Ferrite are public:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [`current-handover-prompt.md`](docs/current-handover-prompt.md) | Active session context |
| [`ai-workflow/`](docs/ai-workflow/) | Full workflow docs, PRDs, historical handovers |
| [`handover/`](docs/handover/) | Reusable handover templates |

This transparency is intentional — I want others to learn from (and improve upon) this approach.

```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from Source</strong></summary>

#### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.70+** - Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Platform-specific dependencies:**

**Windows:**
- Visual Studio Build Tools 2019+ with C++ workload

**Linux:**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install gcc pkg-config gtk3-devel libxcb-devel

# Arch
sudo pacman -S base-devel pkg-config gtk3 libxcb
```

**macOS:**

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite.git
cd Ferrite

# Build release version (optimized)
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at:
# Windows: target/release/ferrite.exe
# Linux/macOS: target/release/ferrite

# macOS: Create .app bundle (optional)
cargo install cargo-bundle
cargo bundle --release
# Bundle will be at: target/release/bundle/osx/Ferrite.app
```

> **macOS "Open With" Limitation:** The app bundle includes file type associations, so Ferrite appears in Finder's "Open With" menu. However, opening files this way (or by dragging files onto the app icon) is not yet supported due to [eframe/winit limitations](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1751). **Workaround:** Open files via Terminal: `open -a Ferrite path/to/file.md` or use File > Open within the app.

> **Development Builds:** Building from the `main` branch gives you the latest features before they're officially released. These builds are untested and may contain bugs. For stable versions, download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/releases).

</details>

## Usage

```bash
# Open a file

<details>
<summary><strong>Configuration details</strong></summary>

Settings are stored in platform-specific locations:

- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\ferrite\`
- **Windows Portable:** `portable\` folder next to `ferrite.exe`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/ferrite/`
- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/ferrite/`

**Portable Mode (Windows):** If a `portable` folder exists next to the executable, Ferrite automatically uses it for all configuration instead of `%APPDATA%`. This makes Ferrite fully self-contained - perfect for USB drives.

Workspace settings are stored in `.ferrite/` within the workspace folder.

### Settings Panel

- **Appearance:** Theme, font family, font size, default view mode
- **Editor:** Word wrap, line numbers, minimap, bracket matching, code folding, syntax highlighting, auto-close brackets, line width
- **Files:** Auto-save, recent files history

</details>
