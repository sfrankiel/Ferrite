# Changelog

All notable changes to Ferrite will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Markdown Linking
- **Wikilinks support** ([#1](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/1)) - `[[target]]` and `[[target|display]]` syntax with relative path resolution, spaces in filenames, click-to-navigate, same-folder-first tie-breaker, ambiguity prompting
- **Backlinks panel** - Panel showing files linking to the current document; graph-based indexing for workspaces >50 files; click-to-navigate; detects both `[[wikilinks]]` and `[markdown](links)`

#### Content Blocks
- **GitHub-style callouts** - `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]` with color-coded rendering, custom titles, and collapsible state (`> [!NOTE]-`)

#### Check for Updates
- **Manual Check for Updates** - Settings → About section with button to check GitHub Releases API; shows up-to-date, update available with download link, or error; user-initiated only (offline-first)
- **Security hardening** - Response URL validated against GitHub releases prefix; TLS via rustls (pure Rust)

#### Large File & Performance
- **Large file detection** - Files >10MB on open show non-blocking performance warning toast
- **Lazy CSV row parsing** - Large CSV/TSV files (≥1MB) now use byte-offset row indexing instead of parsing all rows into memory. Only visible rows (~200) are parsed on demand with viewport caching. For a 1M-row CSV, reduces additional memory from ~100-200MB to ~8MB. Small files (<1MB) now use cached full parse (previously re-parsed every frame)

#### Window & File Handling
- **Single-instance protocol** - Double-clicking files (file tree or OS/Explorer) opens them as tabs in the existing Ferrite window instead of spawning new processes; lock file + TCP IPC

#### Installer (Windows MSI)
- **File associations** - Optional per-extension file type registration (.md, .markdown, .txt, .json, .yaml, .yml, .toml, .csv, .tsv) via OpenWithProgids; adds Ferrite to "Open With" menu and Windows Default Apps settings without overriding existing defaults
- **Explorer context menu** - Optional "Open with Ferrite" right-click entry for files and "Open Folder with Ferrite" for directories (including folder background)
- **Add to System PATH** - Optional PATH entry so `ferrite` can be run from any terminal; cleanly removed on uninstall
- **Desktop shortcut** - Optional desktop shortcut alongside the existing Start Menu shortcut
- **Feature selection UI** - Installer now uses WixUI_FeatureTree with a customization page where users can toggle each feature group independently
- **Launch after install** - "Launch Ferrite" checkbox on the installer exit dialog (checked by default)

#### Editing Modes
- **Vim mode** - Optional Vim-style modal editing with Normal/Insert/Visual modes. Essential Vim commands: hjkl movement, dd (delete line), yy (yank), p (paste), /search, v/V (visual selection). Mode indicator in status bar ([NORMAL]/[INSERT]/[VISUAL]). Toggle in Settings → Editor. Ctrl+ shortcuts still work globally when Vim mode is active.

#### Welcome View
- **Welcome view on first run** - Welcome tab on first launch with configuration for theme, language, editor settings (word wrap, line numbers, minimap, bracket matching, syntax highlighting), max line width, CJK font preference, and auto-save. Only shown when no CLI paths and no session-restored tabs. Contributed by [@blizzard007dev](https://github.com/blizzard007dev) ([PR #80](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/80)).

#### Localization
- **German and Japanese in Settings** - Deutsch and 日本語 now available in Settings → Appearance → Language (locale files already existed)

### Changed

#### Refactoring
- **Flowchart modular refactor** - Split monolithic `flowchart.rs` (3600 lines) into 12 focused modules under `flowchart/` directory: `types.rs`, `parser.rs`, `layout/` (config, graph, subgraph, sugiyama), `render/` (colors, nodes, edges, subgraphs), `utils.rs`. Zero behavior changes, all 83 tests pass.

#### View Mode
- **View mode bar always visible** - The view mode segmented control (Raw/Split/Rendered) now appears for all editor tabs, not just markdown/structured/tabular files. File types that don't support split view (e.g. `.rs`, `.py`, `.txt`) show a compact two-mode segment (Raw | Rendered). When default view mode is Split and a non-split-capable file is opened, the tab automatically falls back to Raw mode.

#### Window Controls
- **Window control button redesign** - Close (×), Minimize (–), Maximize/Restore, and Fullscreen buttons are now drawn with crisp manually-painted icons (line segments, no font glyphs), rounded hover backgrounds (4 px radius), and a more compact footprint (36 × 22 px, down from 46 × 28 px). All four buttons now have consistent rounded-rect hover styling.
- **Close button** - Icon drawn as two diagonal line segments for pixel-accurate rendering; switches to white on red hover.
- **Maximize button** - Rectangle icon with a thicker top edge (2 px) to suggest a window title bar; restore icon unchanged.
- **Fullscreen button** - Replaced broken arrow icon (was rendering as ×) with proper corner-bracket icons: expand ⌜⌝⌞⌟ when windowed, compress when in fullscreen.
- **NE corner resize re-enabled** - Top-right corner (`NorthEast` direction) can now be used to resize the window. The 12 px right margin on the button group keeps the 10 px corner grab zone button-free, so resize and close never conflict. `TITLE_BAR_BUTTON_RIGHT_MARGIN` constant documents the invariant.

### Fixed

- **Light mode text invisible** - All `RichText::strong()` labels (section headers in Settings, Terminal, Files, About, and other panels) were invisible in light mode. Root cause: egui's `strong_text_color()` returns `widgets.active.fg_stroke.color`, which was set to `Color32::WHITE` for the pressed-button state. This bypasses `override_text_color`, rendering white-on-white text. Fixed by setting `active.fg_stroke` to `colors.text.primary` in the light theme.
- **Images not displaying in rendered mode** - Markdown `![](path)` images now render in Rendered/Split view; path resolution relative to document and workspace root; PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP support; graceful placeholders for missing/unsupported files
- **CJK rendering after restart with explicit preference** ([#76](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/76)) - Preload user's preferred CJK font at startup when preference is explicit (non-Auto), so restored tabs render correctly without tofu
- **CJK fonts load on language switch** - Switching to Chinese or Japanese in the Welcome panel (or Settings) now lazily loads the required CJK font immediately, so translated UI labels render correctly instead of showing squares
- **Latin-only names in Language and CJK selectors** - Language and CJK Regional Preference dropdowns now use Latin-only display names (e.g. "Chinese (Simplified)", "Japanese") so they render correctly before CJK fonts load
- **Syntax highlighting per-frame re-parsing** - `highlight_line()` was called every frame before cache check, causing lag on long lines; now checks cache first and only parses on cache miss
- **Scrollbar position with word wrap** - Scrollbar thumb position now uses cumulative y-offsets from height cache instead of uniform line height; scrollbar accurately reflects position
- **Scrollbar drag reverse mapping** - Dragging scrollbar now uses `y_offset_to_line()` binary search instead of uniform division for accurate jumps
- **Scrollbar jumping** - Replaced per-frame `rebuild_height_cache` with dirty-flag approach; smoothed scrollbar height to avoid abrupt changes as wrap info is discovered
- **Crash on large selection delete with word wrap** - Fixed capacity overflow panic when deleting large selections; added `saturating_sub`, viewport clamping, and `truncate_wrap_info()` for stale entries

## [0.2.6.1] - 2026-02-06

> **Patch release:** First code-signed release. Integrated terminal workspace, productivity hub, major app.rs refactoring into ~15 modules, and numerous bug fixes.

### Added

#### Integrated Terminal Workspace 🎉
> Contributed by [@wolverin0](https://github.com/wolverin0) in [PR #74](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/74) — first major community contribution!

- **Multiple terminal instances** - Create and manage multiple terminal sessions with tabs and shell selection (PowerShell, CMD, WSL, bash)
- **Tiling & splitting** - Create complex 2D grids with horizontal and vertical splits
- **Smart maximize** - Temporarily maximize any pane to focus on work (Ctrl+Shift+M)
- **Layout persistence** - Save and load your favorite terminal arrangements to JSON files
- **Theming & transparency** - Custom color schemes (Dracula, etc.) and background opacity
- **Drag-and-drop tabs** - Reorder terminals with visual feedback
- **AI-ready indicator** - Visual "breathing" animation when terminal is waiting for input (perfect for AI agents)

#### Productivity Hub
> Also contributed by [@wolverin0](https://github.com/wolverin0) in [PR #74](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/74)

- **Productivity panel** - Quick-access panel for common editing, navigation, and workflow tasks

#### Editor Improvements
- **Tab drag reorder** - Tabs can now be reordered by dragging with visual drop target indicator and `swap_tabs()` state method
- **File watcher auto-reload** - Externally modified files are now automatically reloaded when the tab has no unsaved changes; shows toast notification. If tab has unsaved changes, shows a warning instead
- **Undo after text formatting** - Bold, italic, and other formatting operations now create discrete undo entries via `break_group()` calls; Ctrl+Z reliably reverses only the format
- **Multiline blockquote rendering** - Consecutive blockquotes separated by blank lines are now merged into a single continuous block with one border
- **CJK first-line paragraph indentation** ([#20](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/20), [#26](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/26)) - Fixed first-line-only indentation for Chinese (2em) and Japanese (1em) paragraphs in rendered mode using egui `LayoutJob` with `leading_space`

#### Security
- **Code signing** - Windows artifacts (exe, MSI, portable zip) are now digitally signed via [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) with a production certificate from [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org). No more "Unknown publisher" warnings from Windows SmartScreen.

#### Memory Optimization
- **Memory diagnostics** - Added `[MEM]` log messages at startup showing memory usage at key initialization points (visible with `--log-level info`)

### Changed

#### App.rs Refactoring
> **Major restructure:** Split the monolithic 7,600+ line `app.rs` into ~15 focused modules under `src/app/`.

- New modules: `mod.rs`, `title_bar.rs`, `central_panel.rs`, `keyboard.rs`, `input_handling.rs`, `line_ops.rs`, `file_ops.rs`, `formatting.rs`, `navigation.rs`, `find_replace.rs`, `export.rs`, `dialogs.rs`, `status_bar.rs`, `helpers.rs`, `types.rs`
- See [refactoring plan](docs/technical/planning/app-rs-refactoring-plan.md)

### Fixed

#### Bug Fixes
- **Duplicate Line (Ctrl+Shift+D) wrong position** - Rewrote `handle_duplicate_line()` to use `cursor_position` (line, col) synced from FerriteEditor instead of stale `tab.cursors` char index
- **Keyboard shortcut conflict: Ctrl+Shift+E** ([#46](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/46)) - `ToggleFileTree` and `ExportHtml` were both bound to `Ctrl+Shift+E`. Changed `ExportHtml` to `Ctrl+Shift+X`
- **Maximize/restore button icon** - Button icon disappeared on hover because text was painted under the hover background. Rewrote to use custom painter drawing
- **Drag-drop image inserts at wrong position** - Image markdown link was inserted at stale `tab.cursors` position instead of actual editor cursor. Now uses `cursor_position` (line, col)
- **Smart paste not working** - Selection state was read from stale `tab.cursors` instead of FerriteEditor. Now queries FerriteEditor directly via `get_ferrite_editor_mut()`
- **Auto-save toggle inconsistency** - Title bar toggle directly flipped `auto_save_enabled` field instead of calling `toggle_auto_save()` which also clears `last_edit_time`
- **Rendered mode raw editor stuttering** - Switching from Rendered to Raw mode caused full FerriteEditor recreation, losing viewport/syntax state. Added `set_content()` method for in-place buffer replacement
- **Keyboard shortcut conflict: Ctrl+Backtick** - `FormatInlineCode` and `ToggleTerminal` both bound to same key. Changed `FormatInlineCode` to `Ctrl+Shift+Backtick`
- **CJK font crash on startup** ([#63](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/63)) - Fixed crash when a non-Auto CJK preference is persisted but the font cannot be loaded. Fonts now return `None` gracefully. Minor: tofu (□) may appear in settings labels when no CJK documents are open (fonts load lazily)
- **Portable Windows startup crash** ([#57](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/57)) - Validate persisted window position values on load. Corrupted values (NaN, infinity, out-of-bounds) are reset so the OS selects a safe default. Portable ZIP now always includes the `portable/` folder

#### Memory Optimization - CJK Font Loading
> **Reduced startup memory by ~80MB** for users with CJK font preferences set.

- **Lazy CJK font loading** - CJK fonts now load on-demand when text containing those scripts is detected, instead of loading all 4 fonts (~80MB) at startup
- **System locale detection** - Automatically detects system language and preloads only the ONE CJK font the user likely needs (~20MB):
  - Japanese locale (ja-JP) → Japanese font only
  - Korean locale (ko-KR) → Korean font only
  - Chinese Simplified (zh-CN) → SC font only
  - Chinese Traditional (zh-TW) → TC font only
  - Other locales → no preload (fully lazy)
- **Settings change optimization** - Changing CJK preference in settings no longer loads all fonts; only already-loaded fonts are preserved

**Memory impact:**
| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| English user, no CJK | ~130 MB | ~50 MB |
| Japanese user | ~130 MB | ~70 MB |
| User with explicit CJK pref | ~130 MB | ~50 MB (loads on-demand) |

- **.txt files in Open dialog** - Text files now visible in default filter

### Fixed

#### Memory & Performance ([#45](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/45))
> **Critical fix:** Opening a 4MB text file caused 1.8GB RAM usage and laggy editor

- **Editor per-frame content clone** - Fixed 240MB/second allocation from cloning document every frame. Now uses lazy undo snapshot pattern.
- **Case-insensitive search allocation** - Fixed full document copy for search. Now uses regex `(?i)` flag for streaming search.
- **Search debouncing** - Added 150ms debounce preventing search on every keystroke.
- **Large file memory optimization** - Files >1MB get hash-based modification detection, cleared original bytes, reduced undo stack (10 vs 100).
- **Bracket matching O(N) fix** - Was allocating entire buffer every frame (4.8GB/sec for 80MB file). Now uses windowed ~20KB extraction.
- **Memory release on tab close** - Memory properly freed when closing large file tabs.

#### Editor Bugs
- **Text jumping to next line** - Fixed cursor unexpectedly jumping when typing at end of line
- **Cannot scroll to bottom** - Fixed missing lines at bottom of large files with/without word wrap
- **Outline/Minimap cursor placement** - Fixed cursor landing several lines below clicked heading
- **Search highlight alignment** - Fixed highlight drift on wrapped lines in large files
- **Box drawing characters** - Fixed U+2500-U+257F rendering as squares (added JetBrains Mono fallback)

#### UI Fixes
- **File browser context menu icons** - Fixed doubled/square icons in right-click menu
- **Link hover gear icon removed** - Click now edits, Ctrl+Click opens in browser
- **Initial cursor visibility** - New documents show blinking cursor immediately
- **Cursor appearance** - Theme-aware color, proper height matching line height
- **Windows Start Menu icon** - Fixed pixelated/low-res icon (proper multi-size .ico)

### Changed

- **Pattern:** Rust's `impl FerriteEditor` distributed across modules

#### Integration Updates
- Format toolbar connected to FerriteEditor buffer operations
- Outline panel and minimap integrated with new scroll system
- Font settings dynamically update editor rendering
- Line numbers toggle works without restart
- File save preserves encoding through FerriteEditor

### Deferred to v0.2.7
- **Editor-Preview scroll synchronization** - Requires deeper investigation into viewport-based line tracking
- **Large file preview disablement** - Preview disabled message for >5MB files
- **SignPath code signing** - Awaiting organization approval

### Technical
- Added `ropey` crate for rope-based text buffer
- New `src/editor/ferrite/` module structure with 15+ submodules
- `LARGE_FILE_THRESHOLD` (1MB) and `LARGE_FILE_MAX_UNDO` (10) constants
- Hash-based modification detection for large files
- Lazy undo snapshot pattern with `pending_undo_state`
- Search debounce with `find_search_pending` and `find_search_requested_at`
- ViewState tracks wrapped line heights for proper scrolling
- LineCache with LRU eviction (200 entries max)

## [0.2.5.3] - 2026-01-24

### Added

#### Flathub Distribution
- **Flathub submission files** - Added `.desktop` and `.metainfo.xml` files for Flathub packaging at `assets/linux/`

#### Code Signing (Pending)
- **SignPath integration** - Windows artifacts (exe, MSI, portable zip) will be code signed via [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) free tier for open source once organization approval is complete. This helps prevent Windows Defender false positives and establishes trust with users.
- **CI/CD signing workflow** - Signing is integrated into GitHub Actions release workflow and will run automatically on tagged releases once approved.

#### UI Improvements
- **View Mode Segmented Control** - Replaced single-letter toggle button (R/S/V) with a polished pill-shaped segmented control showing all three view modes at once. Users can now click directly on the mode they want (Raw, Split, Rendered) with clear visual feedback for the active mode. The control adapts to file type: 3 modes for markdown/CSV, 2 modes for JSON/YAML/TOML. Visible in both normal and Zen mode.
- **App logo in title bar** - Added Ferrite logo with transparent background to the title bar for better brand visibility.

#### Syntax Highlighting
- **Extended syntax support** - Added 100+ additional language syntaxes via `two-face` crate, including PowerShell (.ps1/.psm1/.psd1), TypeScript/TSX, Zig, Svelte, Vue, Terraform, Nix, and many more. Previously unsupported languages now get proper syntax highlighting instead of plain text.
- **Syntax theme selector** - New dropdown in Appearance settings to choose from 25+ syntax highlighting color themes including Dracula, Nord, Catppuccin (Mocha/Latte/Frappe/Macchiato), Gruvbox (light/dark), Solarized (light/dark), One Half, GitHub, VS Code Dark+, and more. Set to "Auto" to match the app theme.

### Fixed

#### Linux Desktop Integration
- **Alt-tab/taskbar visibility on Wayland** - Fixed Ferrite window not appearing in alt-tab switcher or taskbar on Linux desktop environments (KDE Plasma, GNOME) running Wayland. Added `app_id` to ViewportBuilder for proper window identification.

#### Icon Rendering
- **Find/Replace replace icon** - Fixed the replace icon (↳) showing as a square box in the Find and Replace panel. Changed to a universally-supported arrow character (→).
- **Tree viewer context menu icon** - Fixed the context menu button (⋯) in JSON/YAML/TOML tree viewer showing as a square. Changed to simple dots (...) for reliable rendering.
- **Font atlas pre-warming** - Added additional symbols (⇄⇅↳↵…⋯) to the font atlas pre-warm list to ensure they render correctly from startup.

#### UI Positioning
- **Recent files menu position** - Fixed the recent files/folders popup menu appearing below and covering the filename button in the status bar. Menu now appears above the button using proper anchor positioning.

#### Performance
- **Linux folder opening freeze** - Fixed critical 10+ second UI freeze when opening workspace folders on Linux (especially Fedora/KDE Plasma). Root causes:
  - **notify crate misconfiguration** - Was configured with `default-features = false, features = ["macos_kqueue"]` which disabled the inotify backend on Linux, forcing fallback to slow polling-based file watching that had to walk and stat entire directory trees.
  - **Synchronous recursive directory scanning** - `Workspace::new()` scanned the entire directory tree recursively on the main UI thread before showing anything. Now uses lazy loading: only the root directory is scanned initially, subdirectories are scanned on-demand when expanded.

#### Bug Fixes
- **Line breaks in list items** ([#41](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/41)) - Fixed hard line breaks (`\` at end of line) within list items showing as a square box instead of rendering as a proper line break.
- **Git deleted file icon rendering** - Fixed git "deleted" status icon showing as a square box in the file tree. The previous icon character (✕) was not supported by the embedded Inter font. Changed to standard ASCII minus character (-) for reliable cross-platform rendering.
- **Blockquote/table overflow** - Added horizontal scrolling for tables and blockquotes when content exceeds container width. Previously, wide content would expand the layout and break max line width for all subsequent content. Now wide tables scroll horizontally while the rest of the document respects the configured line width setting. Code blocks and mermaid diagrams already have internal horizontal scroll handling.
- **PowerShell file rendering collapse** - Fixed critical bug where PowerShell and other files without syntax definitions would collapse all content to a single line after initial render. Root cause: the fallback path for unsupported languages used `code.lines()` which strips newline characters. Fix uses `LinesWithEndings` to preserve newlines in plain text rendering.
- **View mode segment not clickable** - Fixed issue on Linux where clicking the view mode segment (R/S/V buttons) in the title bar would initiate window drag instead of switching modes. Increased the drag exclusion zone width to fully cover all title bar controls.
- **Inter font missing box-drawing characters** - Fixed box-drawing characters (─│┌┐└┘ etc.) rendering as squares when using Inter font. The embedded Inter font doesn't include Unicode box-drawing block (U+2500-U+257F). Added JetBrains Mono as fallback font for Inter to provide these characters.

## [0.2.5.2] - 2026-01-20

### Added

#### New Features
- **Delete Line shortcut** ([#29](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/29)) - Cmd/Ctrl+D deletes current line (configurable in settings) - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!
- **Move Line Up/Down** ([#29](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/29)) - Alt+Up/Down swaps current line with adjacent line - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!
- **macOS file type associations** ([#30](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/30)) - Ferrite appears in Finder's "Open With" menu for .md, .json, .yaml, .toml, .txt files - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!

#### Installation & Distribution
- **Windows portable build** - True portable mode (`ferrite-portable-windows-x64.zip`) with `portable` folder for self-contained operation. All settings stored next to executable - perfect for USB drives.
- **Windows MSI installer** - Proper Windows installer (`ferrite-windows-x64.msi`) with Start Menu shortcut, application icon, and clean uninstall support via Windows Settings. Built with WiX Toolset.
- **Linux RPM package** - Native package (`ferrite-editor.x86_64.rpm`) for Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Rocky Linux, and other RPM-based distributions. Includes desktop entry and icon integration.

#### Internationalization
- **I18n audit & cleanup** - Comprehensive audit of hardcoded strings, replacement with translation keys
- **Orphaned key removal** - Removed ~200 unused translation keys from locale files
- **Locale file sync** - All locale files now have consistent structure matching en.yaml
- **New language support** - Added Estonian and Norwegian Bokmål via Weblate community translations

### Fixed

#### Bug Fixes
- **Ctrl+X cutting entire document** - Fixed egui bug where Ctrl+X with no text selection would cut the entire document. Now correctly does nothing when nothing is selected.
- **Linux window drag stuck mouse** - Fixed critical bug where dragging the custom title bar on Linux caused the mouse to get "stuck" in drag mode. Root cause: egui's widget-level drag tracking desynchronized with the window manager after `ViewportCommand::StartDrag`. Fix bypasses egui's drag state machine entirely, using raw input detection (`primary_pressed()`) for immediate, reliable window drag initiation.
- **Split mode cursor position** ([#29](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/29)) - Line operations now work correctly in Split view; rendered pane no longer overwrites cursor position - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!
- **macOS modifier tooltips** ([#28](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/28), [#29](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/pull/29)) - Tooltips now show "Cmd+E" on macOS instead of hardcoded "Ctrl+E" - thanks [@abcd-ca](https://github.com/abcd-ca)!
- **Semantic minimap highlight accuracy** - Use byte offsets matching search behavior for correct highlight positioning

> **Note:** Opening files via "Open With" or dragging onto app icon not yet supported on macOS due to [winit#1751](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1751). Workaround: use `open -a Ferrite file.md` or File > Open.

## [0.2.5.1] - 2026-01-17

### Added

#### Idle Mode CPU Optimization
- **Tiered idle repaint system** - Implements intelligent repaint scheduling based on user interaction time:
  - Active (animations/dialogs): Continuous repaint at 60 FPS
  - Light idle (0-2 seconds): 100ms interval (~10 FPS)
  - Deep idle (2+ seconds): 500ms interval (~2 FPS)
- **User interaction tracking** - Detects keyboard, mouse, and scroll activity to determine idle state
- **Scroll animation awareness** - Continuous repaint during sync scroll animations

#### Multi-Encoding File Support
- **Automatic encoding detection** - Files are now automatically detected for encoding on open using `encoding_rs` and `chardetng` crates. No more garbled text when opening legacy files.
- **Common encoding support** - Full support for Latin-1, Windows-1252, ISO-8859-x, Shift-JIS, EUC-KR, GBK, and other common encodings beyond UTF-8.
- **Status bar indicator** - Current file encoding displayed in status bar with click-to-change dropdown menu for manual encoding selection.
- **Preserve encoding on save** - Files are saved back in their original encoding by default, not forced to UTF-8.

#### Memory Optimization
- **CJK font lazy loading** - CJK fonts (Korean, Japanese, Chinese) are now loaded on-demand when CJK characters are detected in documents, rather than at startup. This reduces idle memory usage from ~250MB to ~72MB for non-CJK users.
- **Granular per-language CJK loading** - Each CJK language font is loaded independently based on detected script (Hangul → Korean font, Hiragana/Katakana → Japanese font, Han characters → user's preferred Chinese variant). Opening a Korean document only loads Korean fonts (~30MB), not all CJK fonts (~180MB).
- **Custom memory allocators** - Platform-specific high-performance allocators: `mimalloc` on Windows, `jemalloc` on Linux/macOS. Reduces heap fragmentation and memory usage, especially for long-running sessions.
- **Viewer state cleanup** - Fixed memory leak by cleaning up `tree_viewer_states`, `csv_viewer_states`, and `sync_scroll_states` HashMap entries when tabs are closed.
- **egui temp data cleanup** - Stale `SyntaxHighlightCache` and per-tab temporary data cleared from egui memory on tab close.

#### Cursor Positioning Improvements
- **Galley-based click mapping** - Use egui's Galley for accurate click-to-character index conversion in rendered/split view click-to-edit.
- **Formatting marker mapping** - Map displayed text positions to raw markdown positions accounting for `**`, `*`, `` ` ``, `~~`, and `[links](url)` syntax.
- **Text wrapping support** - Handle wrapped lines correctly by using actual text rect width for measurement.
- **Bold font measurement** - Use bold font for measurement when content starts with bold markers for better accuracy.

#### Scroll Navigation Accuracy
- **Unified scroll calculation** - Single function for all scroll-to-line operations (find, search-in-files, outline, minimap) ensuring consistent positioning.
- **Fixed off-by-one errors** - Consistent 0-indexed vs 1-indexed line number handling across all navigation functions.
- **Fresh line height** - Ensure actual rendered line height is used instead of stale/default values when calculating scroll positions.
- **Large file accuracy** - Scroll navigation now works correctly in files with 3000+ lines; previously target lines could be hundreds of pixels off or completely out of view.
- **Semantic minimap highlight fix** - Fixed highlight offset when clicking items in semantic minimap/outline panel. The highlight now correctly marks the target line by using byte offsets (matching search behavior) instead of character offsets.

#### Settings & UX
- **Session restore option** - New setting to disable tab restoration on startup. When disabled, app starts with a single empty tab instead of restoring previous session.

### Fixed

#### CPU Usage Optimization
- **Fixed 10% idle CPU usage** - Application now uses <1% CPU when truly idle (previously ~10% even with no user interaction)
- **Window title optimization** - Only send viewport title command when title actually changes, avoiding per-frame overhead
- **Disabled repaint on widget change** - Set `options.repaint_on_widget_change = false` to prevent unnecessary repaints
- **Animation time optimization** - Removed conflicting animation_time override in ThemeManager

#### Intel Mac CPU Usage ([#24](https://github.com/OlaProeis/Ferrite/issues/24))
- **Removed verbose debug logging** - Eliminated `[LIST_ITEM_DEBUG]` statements in rendered mode that generated ~50,000 log lines per 22 seconds.
- **Fixed continuous repaint in Rendered mode** - Root cause: `Sense::hover()` on scroll area content caused ~60fps repaints bypassing idle throttling. Changed to `Sense::focusable_noninteractive()` for proper ~10fps idle throttling.

#### Bug Fixes
- **New file dirty flag** - New untitled files no longer prompt to save when closed if they haven't been modified.
- **CJK first-line indentation** - Paragraph indentation now correctly applies only to the first line, not the entire paragraph.
- **Workspace close button alignment** - X button to close workspace panel shifted left to prevent overlap with resize handles.
- **Linux close button** - Fixed issue where window close button couldn't be clicked due to hit-testing/overlay interference.

### Technical
- New `last_interaction_time` field tracks user activity for idle detection
- New `get_idle_repaint_interval()` returns appropriate interval based on idle duration
- New `had_user_input()` detects keyboard, mouse, and scroll events
- Enhanced `needs_continuous_repaint()` to check for scroll animations
- Explicit vsync and run_and_return settings in NativeOptions
- Added FPS diagnostic logging (debug builds only) for idle CPU optimization verification
- New `CjkScriptDetection` struct and `detect_cjk_scripts()` function for granular script identification
- Per-language `AtomicBool` flags track which CJK fonts have been loaded
- `CjkLoadSpec` determines fonts to load based on detected scripts and user preferences
- Platform-conditional allocator setup in `main.rs` with feature flags
- Documentation: [Idle Mode Optimization](docs/technical/platform/idle-mode-optimization.md)

### Changed
